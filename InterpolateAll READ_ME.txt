InterpolateAll.py READ ME



Dear user,

This program’s main purpose is to interpolate a dataset in a ChuLab’s text file.

The original data set is in blue while the interpolated one is in red.

Output text file is in C:\\Users.

Please forward additional features to Winnie.

Sincerely,

Winnie Wang

###—Versions—###
Ver. Alpha

- Dev stage: Using last template from PlotAll.py

- Plotting works fine


Ver. 1.0

- Works for interpolation of one data set only; output file is in C:\\Users



Ver. 1.1

- Added a tk.Entry box for user entry; it divides/multiples the total number of data set by the entered number to determine the number of intervals for coarser/finer interpolation; hence the higher the number, the more coarse/fine the interpolation would be



Ver. 1.2

- Combined both coarse and fine interpolation into one single run 

- User also types in the number they want to see in the fine interpolation
(coarse interpolation runs first with N_avg, then fine interpolation runs with total pts.)

Ver. 1.3

- Revamped user interface; added more description
