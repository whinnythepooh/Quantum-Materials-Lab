Dear user,

To use the script, right-click on any interested text (*.txt) file with data from this lab. 

The command ("Python_plotAll") appear as the third command from the top.

Due to debugging purposes, there will be several updates. The updates are on the bottom. 

If the script stops working, or you would have a feature to be implemented on the program, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Winnie Wang
