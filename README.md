This GitHub contains the codes that I had used to analyze the data files that are used in the lab, after experiments are done from the cryostat. 

Note that the code only follows a specific format, so this is not for universal use. 

It also contains the presentation files that I presented to my laboratory PI with regards to calibrating our elastoresistance measurements.

If you have any concerns, or you would like to use this code, please contact me.

Sincerely,

Winnie Wang,

Undergrad. Research Assistant
