This GitHub contains the codes that I had used to analyze the data files that are used in the lab, after experiments are done from the cryostat. Note that the code only follows a specific format, so this is not for universal use. It also contains the presentation files that I presented to my laboratory PI with regards to calibrating our elastoresistance measurements.
